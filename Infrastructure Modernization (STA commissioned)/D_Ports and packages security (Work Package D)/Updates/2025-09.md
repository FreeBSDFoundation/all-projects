## Status

In progress.

## Community engagement

Our contractor continues to engage with key community SMEs to understand the pertinent parts of the FreeBSD system, tools and processes. Our monthly meetings, combined with ad hoc direct communication seems to be working well to keep our contractor aligned with community stakeholder needs. The process of using GitHub pull requests is also a good mechanism for facilitating asynchronous collaboration on code changes and proof of concepts. As design decisions are made, we will begin to communicate these by mailing list.

## Project Progress

Work is complete on:

* Add support for the new format in FreeBSD’s package manager.  
  * OSV parsing capability is now present in FreeBSD’s pkg module so that the database can be understood in this format.   
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2453](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2453)  
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2513](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2513)  
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2512](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2512) 

Work is in progress on:

* Select a new format for the Vulnerability Database.  
  * This is almost complete:  
    * OSV format chosen.   
    * Individual JSON files for vulnerability data storage.   
    * Single, combined JSON file for distribution to pkg(8) when \`pkg audit\` is run.  
  * A naming convention for the ID of the files has been proposed and sent to the FreeBSD Security Team to review. We await approval or feedback.  
* Migrate Data from old to new database  
  * With the format reviewed and supported, we now have the tooling necessary to carry out this step.  
  * The naming convention needs to be approved so the migration can be completed.  
* Deliver vulnerability data into the SBOM on demand  
  * Our contractor is helping to get BSD supported by the PURL (Package URL) spec [https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/496](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/496). This is waiting on the approval of the naming convention as previously mentioned. 

## Risks, concerns, and variations

As mentioned in the progress section, there is a dependency on the FreeBSD Security Team providing feedback on the proposed naming ID convention. One of the Foundation staff is in the Security Team so we have a means of direct engagement to move this forward.
