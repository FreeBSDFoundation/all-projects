## Status

In progress.

## Community engagement

Our contractor continues to engage with key community SMEs to understand the relevant parts of the FreeBSD system, tools and processes. Our monthly meetings, combined with ad hoc direct communication seems to be working well to keep our contractor aligned with community stakeholder needs. The process of using GitHub pull requests is also a good mechanism for facilitating asynchronous collaboration on code changes and proof of concepts. As design decisions are made, we will begin to communicate these by mailing list.

There are also changes being submitted to upstream open source projects which are needed to ensure the solution works.

## Project Progress

Work is complete on:

* Add support for the new format in FreeBSD’s package manager.  
  * OSV parsing capability is now present in FreeBSD’s pkg module so that the database can be understood in this format.   
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2453](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2453)  
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2513](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2513)  
    * Closed: [https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2512](https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/pull/2512)   
* Select a new format for the Vulnerability Database.  
  * OSV format chosen.   
    * Individual JSON files for vulnerability data storage.   
    * Single, combined JSON file for distribution to pkg(8) when \`pkg audit\` is run.  
  * A naming convention for the ID of the files has been approved by the FreeBSD Security Team and a pull request has been submitted upstream to the OSV project to include it. [https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/448](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/448)  

Work is in progress on:

* Migrate Data from old to new database  
  * A test database is now complete and is ready for review by subject matter experts from within the community.  
* Deliver vulnerability data into the SBOM on demand  
  * Our contractor is helping to get BSD supported by the PURL (Package URL) spec [https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/496](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/496). This PR has been adapted to include only FreeBSD-related changes as the other BSDs are taking another approach. It is with the upstream project (PURL) to review and we will be following up with them to ask for this to be done.    
* Documentation  
  * This has started now a good portion of the work is completed.
