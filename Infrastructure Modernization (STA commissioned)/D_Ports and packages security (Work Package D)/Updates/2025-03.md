This work package is scheduled to start in April 2025\. (In the February report, it erroneously stated that it was due to start in March.)

We have been working with key stakeholders in the community to scope the work in more detail. We are on track to recruit a FTE engineer to cover a large part of both Work Packages D and E.

A change in wording to the scope of the work package was approved by Sovereign Tech Agency via email on March 19th 2025\.

The change was from:

*Migrate from our VuXML Vulnerability Database to OSV*  
to:   
*Migrate from our VuXML Vulnerability Database to OSV or similar contemporary format.*

and the intent of the change was to allow flexibility in choosing a format for the solution.
