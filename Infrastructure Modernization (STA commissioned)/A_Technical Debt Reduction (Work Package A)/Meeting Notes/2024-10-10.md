Notes

* Foundation update
    * We have been working with Bitergia and they have successfully connected to the Bugzilla data source, and have created a dashboard for us. 
    * They have done some knowledge gathering with the srcmgr@ team and Foundation staff and are producing tailored dashboard views to help us understand and monitor the backlog.They will also produce a short report at the end of the engagement to give us a summary of the backlog characterisation. This could also be used to create marketing content, and we have offered to do some co-marketing if they like.
    * Moin is now our contracted resource on the STF Work Package A and is in the process of deploying GrimoireLab (the open source dashboard that Bitergia uses) on our own hosted instance, on FreeBSD. 
    * Notes from our calls with Bitergia are available 
* Community update
    * srcmgr@ biweekly call was last Friday. srcmgr@ has announced to the community and promised further updates. This includes triaging. 
    * Mark plans to set up a virtual/online bug squashing event. Perhaps the analysis work can help to inform these. Still thinking about the best format for this. But not a blocker/requirement. Mark Linman is also closing bugs in the background. 
* Review the plan to look ahead at upcoming tasks
    * Mark will be working on labeling the bugs, and reviewing the backlog. 
    * Communication strategy for community, have regular opportunities for people to join calls, see what is happening. No difference to what is already happening, just more proactive. Not likely to batch/bulk close bugs. 
    * We have about 20 src bugs per week coming in. Now the srcmgr@ team is triaging bugs, and Mark L is closing bugs we are trending downwards on backlog size.
    * The other view is that we should close all bugs over 4y old as itâ€™s not time efficient to go through all bugs and interact with them. Making bugzilla usable (through reducing the number of bugs) would be a good outcome.
    * It might still be a good idea to batch close bugs, not on issue age though. Having a good classification system will be helpful in making the backlog manageable/navigable. 
* Decisions
  * none
