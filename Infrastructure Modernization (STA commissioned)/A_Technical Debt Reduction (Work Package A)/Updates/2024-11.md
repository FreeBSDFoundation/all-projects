## Community engagement

Our engagement with [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) has finished and the FreeBSD Projectâ€™s Source Manager team has now taken ownership of the dashboards created as part of the project. 

The focus of our bi-weekly steering meeting with Source Manager is now on integrating the dashboards into their processes. 

They are planning a public bug-remediation event for the community to take place on 2024-12-06 with the intention of building community engagement and best practice in bug management. 

We have set up the [GrimoireLab dashboards on FreeBSD](https://grimoire.freebsd.org/), which is the first time that this open source tool has been hosted on the operating system. We are planning on co-marketing our project with Bitergia to share our lessons learned with the wider open source community.  

## Project Progress

The project is in its final stages, and we are focusing on supporting the Source Manager team to put in place its updated processes, ensure the dashboards are working properly, and carry out bug triage and remediation. 

We have had reduced developer availability due to holidays and will be requesting the STA to consider allowing us to move some of the work on technical debt reduction into early 2025

## Risks, concerns, and variations

This month we have been working smoothly and at a good pace. As mentioned earlier, we will be asking to have a time extension to Work Package A to allow us to catch up on using the planned hours in early 2025\.
