## Community engagement

Our contractor continues to engage with key community SMEs to understand the pertinent parts of the FreeBSD system, tools and processes. Our monthly meetings, combined with ad hoc direct communication seems to be working well to keep our contractor aligned with community stakeholder needs.

## Project Progress

Work is in progress on:

* Evaluate SBOM-generation solutions	  
  * Created and submitted multiple new FreeBSD ports specifically for SBOM generation and analysis, including py-lib4sbom, py-distro2sbom, and supporting libraries.   
  * Reintegrated the ScanCode Toolkit, previously removed from ports, with enhanced SBOM capabilities that can generate SBOMs for both FreeBSD Ports and source code.   
  * Carried out comprehensive license analysis of the XZ utility using ScanCode Toolkit and ClearlyDefined, demonstrating the SBOM tools' ability to identify and validate SPDX license headers. This work highlighted the need for better automated license determination processes.  
* Produce an SBOM in CI (e.g. weekly builds).  
  * Researched likely consumers of the final SBOM to help inform the solution design.  
  * The industries with the most mature SBOM consumption are automotive, electric, and arms manufacturing sectors, with security being the main driver rather than license compliance. SPDX 2.2 has been identified as the most widely adopted standard.  
* Produce an SBOM as a release artifact as part of the release process.  
  * Investigated how to produce an SBOM from Ports, and which language is best suited to programming the solution. Python has been identified as the preferred language for SBOM generation due to available library support.  
  * Agreed to focus on a limited number of key Ports for this work package as there are thousands of potential Ports to cover. This will also provide a smaller number of higher-quality examples that can be shared with Ports developers to help raise the standard across the whole collection. We are targeting 10 security-relevant packages for initial SBOM development, including OpenSSH, OpenSSL, GCC, binutils, clang, and XZ \- all critical components already present in FreeBSD's base system.

## Risks, concerns, and variations

We have been surveying the project staff to understand planned absences and we may have some under-allocation for this work package. We are planning to pair a staff member with the contractor to allow better handover for vacation periods. This will also give us more than one person who understands the work which is a benefit in terms of CAF ([contributor absence factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributor-absence-factor/#:~:text=The%20Contributor%20Absence%20Factor%20assesses,for%2050%25%20of%20total%20contributions.)).
