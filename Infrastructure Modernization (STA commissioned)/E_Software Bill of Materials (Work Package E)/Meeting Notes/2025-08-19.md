## Work items (numbering starts at 3\)

3. Evaluate projects/solutions available in the wider ecosystem (to avoid building a whole new solution) e.g. Ariadne's pkgconf proposal.

   * Decisions/questions. Decisions: Do we proceed with SPDX (yes \- Ed approves). Adopt SPDX 3.0 is the standard, using the "lite" profile https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/annexes/spdx-lite/ to start for prototyping. Which output file format should we use: All the following are supported by SPDX: (JSON-LD: A lightweight, JSON-based format for representing Linked Data, making it easy to integrate structured data into web applications while being both human-readable and machine-processable. Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language): A user-friendly, compact format for writing RDF data, using a simple syntax to represent subjects, predicates, and objects in a way that's easy to read and edit. N-Triples: A simple, line-based format for representing RDF data as individual statements, where each line consists of a subject, predicate, and object, making it easy to read and process. RDF/XML: An XML-based format for representing RDF data, allowing structured information about resources and their relationships to be stored and shared in a machine-readable way.) Let's go for TSV (N-Triples) to start for prototyping. Tooling decisions \* pkgconf or aboutfiles (by aboutcode project) are both options. GitLab seemingly uses a JSON/release file but it seems a bit proprietary to GL. Let's continue with pkgconf for prototyping. It seems useful and suitable. \* Do we want to use pkgconf files for linking or are they just for SBOMs? We would like to encourage use of pkgconf for helping building applications as well as for SBOM generation. What is the minimum set of packages that we should include in the SBOM. Choose the most commonly-used but look for some diversity? Pierre Pronchery may be able to advise on which packages are top of the list based on his Alpha Omega project work (called "beach clean").
