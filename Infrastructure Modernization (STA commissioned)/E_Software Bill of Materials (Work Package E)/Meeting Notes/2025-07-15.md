## Work items (numbering starts at 3\)

3. Evaluate projects/solutions available in the wider ecosystem (to avoid building a whole new solution) e.g. Ariadne's pkgconf proposal.

   * tuukka has been evaluating pkgconf and created a GH repo to test it out. https://github.com/illuusio/freebsd-src/tree/pkgconfig-test/pkgconfig . It's not really meant for this use, but can be made to work. Does not include licence link or source code link. Is this OK? AS it's a tool normally used for compiling, should we use it for makefiles. Perhaps Tuukka can speak with the pkgconf project to see what their thoughts are. pkgconf gives some good benefits e.g. version number of the software. They could be open to supporting and/or clauses in their tool. Could we have an interim solution where we point to an external file with the information contained. Tuukka had an idea to summarise all the licence text in the SBOMs but it has been quite a big task \- is there an alternative way or is it useful? Next \- Tuukka meet with pkgconf and ports sec to get input. And help Moin to test his tool. His tool is in Python to compare the structure of licence files with the template. C or Python is the only language fast enough (FLUA is too slow). See if pkgconf is in the core, and if it's not (and if we want it to be) can we add it? Baptiste is on vacation this month. Document the proposal for SPDX and send it to a relevant mailing list for feedback, and the core/port manager teams. then get moin's tool into source in C. Moin has put in a proposal to give all port licences/rename licences an SPDX identifier. This is being blocked currently because. Moin wants to programmatically rename licence files to ensure that they accurately represent the licence statement inside. (Type of licence.) Do we need a PURL for FreeBSD? If so, is it suitable for SBOM or just licences? We don't know if it's well-adopted yet. https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/431 we would need a PURL for src, core, packages. We can make a pull request to propose a spec.
