## Status

In progress.

## Community engagement

Community engagement in August remains similar to July, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review (in both directions).

## Project Progress

As reported last month, one part of our work is completed:

* Standardize all source release build cases using non-root for the creation of release artifacts (ISO & memstick). This will be announced once the other release artifacts are also able to be built without root privileges (specifically *Build cloud VM images as non-root* mentioned below).  
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The work is now completed and has been tested in a range of use cases including when creating a range of VM image formats, cloudware images, and cross-compilation for tier 1 architecture (ARM64, AMD64). This means that the ability to build FreeBSD reproducibly will be more accessible to users who have diverse setups for building FreeBSD.   
  * Relevant code reviews:

Work is ongoing to: 

* Build cloud VM images as non-root.  
  * As well as the ISO and memstick images, we are working to make it possible to build VM images for cloud use without needing root privilege.  
  * Work is ongoing to make sure it’s possible to install packages into the cloud images without need for root privilege.  
  * Some additional testing is being carried out to ensure that we have confidence in the reproducibility of the VM images as byte-for-byte reproducibility is not possible, requiring us to take a more in-depth inspection of the outputs.  
  * This is on track to be ready (patches which enable non-root cloudware image builds in code review) in early September.   
* *NOTE: This is still in queue for review with our community stakeholder. He is currently engaged with working on the upcoming FreeBSD 15.0 release which has slowed things down.* Formalize and document `make world` and `release.sh` in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This is finalized and has been added to a new repository in the FreeBSD GitHub Organization. It is waiting for final review from the community stakeholder.


Work has started on:

* Ports to build reproducibly.  
  * We have revived some old work to get a head start on making it possible to build Ports reproducibly ([https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50911)](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50911). This has been tested locally, amended as needed, and the next step is to add it to Jenkins for further testing. We will also have to decide how often to run the reproducibility tests on Ports.  
* CI to verify reproducibility.  
  * This was a focus at the latest hackathon (in Berlin, mid-July), and is in the planning stage.

We have removed the following from scope:

* Use enclaves: Use enclaves for building (VM inside VM) which is available on various cloud providers.  
  * It was a low-priority “nice to have” requirement, and though we would like to do it at some point it can not happen this year as there is too much work to set this up (significant dependencies on kernel changes).

#### Risks, concerns, and variations

As with the last two months, we are still at risk of lost communication between the people involved over the vacation season. We have an additional staff member who is familiar with these areas of the codebase who we have asked to attend all of the work package meetings to help spot overlapping work and bring some continuity of understanding across the project.
