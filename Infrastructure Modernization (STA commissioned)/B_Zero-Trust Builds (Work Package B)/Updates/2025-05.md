## Community engagement

Community engagement in May remains similar to in April, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review (in both directions).

## Project Progress

One part of our work is completed:

* Standardize all source release build cases using no-root for creation of release artifacts (ISO & memstick).  
  * This means that FreeBSD standard release media (hybrid ISO images and USB memstick images) can now be built without root privilege, making the build processes more secure, easier to automate, and more consistent.   
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49300](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49300)  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49785](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49785)  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121)  
  * Basic VM images also build without root privilege.  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49738](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49738)   
  * This is an important milestone and we will be announcing this along with the ability to build cloud VM images as non-root once that is also completed.

Work is ongoing on:

* Build cloud VM images as non-root.  
  * As well as the ISO and memstick images, we are working to make it possible to build VM images for cloud use without needing root privilege.  
* Formalize and document make world and release.sh in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This is in review and changes are being made based on the feedback received.  
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The work in review is mainly completed, with one outstanding issue that needs reviewing.

    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492)   
  * Creating an article for FreeBSD documentation to explain how to test release builds with Poudriere (a FreeBSD tool for building and testing packages, especially in a bulk fashion).  
    * This is still in progress.
