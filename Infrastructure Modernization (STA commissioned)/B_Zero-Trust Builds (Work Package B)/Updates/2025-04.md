## Community engagement

Community engagement in April remains similar to in March, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review. 

## Project Progress

Work is ongoing on 3 of our highest priority work items for this package:

* Standardize all source release build cases using no-root for creation of release artifacts.  
  * Work is progressing well on this, with most of the changes already submitted and closed in Pull Requests to FreeBSD.   
  * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49300](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49300), [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49785](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49785), [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121)      
* Formalize and document make world and release.sh in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This is almost complete and should be in review any day now.   
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The work has been submitted for review and our staff member is currently addressing community feedback:  
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488)  
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531)  
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49602](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49602)   
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49601](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49601)   
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531)   
    * [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492)   
  * Creating an article for FreeBSD documentation to explain how to test release builds with Poudriere (a FreeBSD tool for building and testing packages, especially in a bulk fashion).

Another work item has started in April: 

* Build VM images. Inc. disk images for clouds as non-root  
  * Progress is good, and basic VM (Virtual Machine) images can now be built with no-root. [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49738](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49738) 

## Risks, concerns, and variations

As mentioned in the March report, some of the work that we have planned will need to be submitted to the FreeBSD Project with careful timing so that it does not conflict with the release process of FreeBSD 15.0 which begins in September for a December release date. We have reviewed the work which will be affected and set work dates accordingly.
