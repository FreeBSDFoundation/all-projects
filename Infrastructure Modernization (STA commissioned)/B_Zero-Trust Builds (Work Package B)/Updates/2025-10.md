## Status

In progress.

## Community engagement

Community engagement in October remains similar to September, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review (in both directions).

Our update on the completed no-root builds is now published [https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-now-builds-reproducibly-and-without-root-privilege/](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-now-builds-reproducibly-and-without-root-privilege/).

## Project Progress

As reported last month, one part of our work is completed:

* Standardize all source release build cases using non-root for the creation of release artifacts (ISO & memstick). This will be announced once the other release artifacts are also able to be built without root privileges (specifically *Build cloud VM images as non-root* mentioned below).  
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The work is now completed and has been tested in a range of use cases including when creating a range of VM image formats, cloudware images, and cross-compilation for tier 1 architecture (ARM64, AMD64). This means that the ability to build FreeBSD reproducibly will be more accessible to users who have diverse setups for building FreeBSD.   
  * Relevant code reviews:

    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492)   
* Build cloud VM images as non-root.  
  * VM images for cloud use can now be built without needing root privilege.

Work newly completed this month:

* Address dependencies  
  * Adding *create pkgbase VM and cloud images*. It’s now more practical to create pkgbase-based VM and cloud images without requiring elevated privileges, using the same secure, unprivileged methods developed for other release artifacts. This allows pkgbase images which assemble the base system from individual packages rather than a monolithic installation to be built safely in automated and containerized environments alongside ISOs and other release formats. This is now available in FreeBSD 15.0 Alpha (pre-release) build. 

Work is ongoing for: 

* Ports to build reproducibly.  
  * This work is code complete and now in review.  
* Formalize and document `make world` and `release.sh` in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This has been reviewed by the community stakeholders and our developer is making the requested changes. There is a code slush on Docs at the moment which means that the change cannot be made live until that is over (November).  
* CI to verify reproducibility.  
  * This is now in review. Once approved this will provide some additional tests in precommit CI scripts that create builds under identical conditions.   
* Address dependencies  
  * Enable bhyve (hypervisor) to operate virtual machines without requiring elevated privileges. NOTE: The original line item 'Address Dependencies' was relatively loosely scoped. Following the successful completion of no-root infrastructure for building VM images and release artifacts, we've identified an opportunity to extend this unprivileged approach to bhyve itself, allowing VMs to be operated without root access.

## Risks, concerns, and variations

One of our contractors has had to step back from the project and we are in the process of reallocating work.
