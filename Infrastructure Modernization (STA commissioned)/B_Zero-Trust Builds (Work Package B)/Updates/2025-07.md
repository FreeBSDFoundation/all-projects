## Community engagement

Community engagement in July remains similar to June, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review (in both directions).

The community had a hackathon in Berlin on July 12 and 13th, which some of our contractors attended to collaborate on elements of this work package [https://wiki.freebsd.org/Hackathon/202507](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Hackathon/202507). 

## Project Progress

As reported last month, one part of our work is completed:

* Standardize all source release build cases using non-root for the creation of release artifacts (ISO & memstick). This will be announced once the other release artifacts are also able to be built without root privileges (specifically *Build cloud VM images as non-root* mentioned below).


Newly completed:

* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The work is now completed and has been tested in a range of use cases including when creating a range of VM image formats, cloudware images, and cross-compilation for tier 1 architecture (ARM64, AMD64). This means that the ability to build FreeBSD reproducibly will be more accessible to users who have diverse setups for building FreeBSD.

Work is ongoing to: 

* Build cloud VM images as non-root.  
  * As well as the ISO and memstick images, we are working to make it possible to build VM images for cloud use without needing root privilege.  
  * Work is ongoing to make sure itâ€™s possible to install packages into the cloud images without need for root privilege.  
  * This is on track to be ready (patches which enable non-root cloudware image builds in code review) towards the end of August.  
* Formalize and document `make world` and `release.sh` in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This is finalized and has been added to a new repository in the FreeBSD GitHub Organization. It is waiting for final review from the community stakeholder.


Work has started on:

* Ports to build reproducibly.  
  * We are reviving some old work to get a head start on making it possible to build Ports reproducibly ([https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50911)](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50911). This will be tested locally, amended as needed, and then added to Jenkins for further testing.  
* CI to verify reproducibility.  
  * This was a focus at the latest hackathon (in Berlin, mid-July), and is in the planning stage.

## Risks, concerns, and variations

As with last month, we are at risk of lost communication between the people involved over the vacation season. We have invited one of our new staff members (who is familiar with these areas of the codebase) to attend all of the work package meetings, to help spot overlapping work and bring some continuity of understanding across the project).
