#### Community engagement

Community engagement in June remains similar to May, with Foundation contractors and staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review (in both directions).

An update on all work packages was presented to the community in the [FreeBSD Foundation Technology Team update](https://www.youtube.com/live/9Gm-IGA2t0s?feature=shared&t=23882) at the FreeBSD Developer Summit in Ottawa on June 12th, 2025\. 

#### Project Progress

As reported last month, one part of our work is completed:

* Standardize all source release build cases using no-root for creation of release artifacts (ISO & memstick). This will be announced once the other release artifacts are also able to be built without root privileges (specifically Build cloud VM images as mentioned below).

Work is ongoing on: 

* Build cloud VM images as non-root.  
  * As well as the ISO and memstick images, we are working to make it possible to build VM images for cloud use without needing root privilege.  
  * This should be ready before the target date of August 8th.  
* Formalize and document make world and release.sh in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * This is in review and changes are being made based on the feedback received.  
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * The main body of work is now completed:  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488)  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531)  
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49602](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49602)   
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49601](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49601)   
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531)   
    * Closed: [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492)   
  * The current focus is in testing the ability to build FreeBSD reproducibly in a wider range of use cases, including when creating a range of VM image formats, cloudware images, and cross-compilation for tier 1 architecture (ARM64, AMD64). This will mean that the ability to build FreeBSD reproducibly will be more accessible to users who have diverse setups for building FreeBSD. 

#### Risks, concerns, and variations

WPB and C have the largest number of people contributing to them and, with vacation season, there is more chance of lost communication between the people involved. We have invited one of our new staff members (who is familiar with these areas of the codebase) to attend all of the work package meetings, to help spot overlapping work and bring some continuity of understanding across the project).
