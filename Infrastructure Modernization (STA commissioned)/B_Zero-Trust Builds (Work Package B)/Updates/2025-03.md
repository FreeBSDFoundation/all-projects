## Community engagement

Community engagement in March remains similar to in February, with Foundation contract/staff developers engaging with volunteer contributors while making changes and submitting patches for review. 

## Project Progress

Work is ongoing on 3 of our highest priority work items for this package:

* Standardize all source release build cases using no-root for creation of release artifacts.  
  * Work is progressing well on this, with some of the changes already submitted in Pull Requests to FreeBSD. [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49488), [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49492), [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D49531), [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48121)       
* Formalize and document make world and release.sh in the context of providing joined-up documentation for a user who wants to understand  reproducible builds and directions on how to do it.  (Some documentation already exists but is not necessarily up to date.)  
  * The foundational content has been completed, including the variables that affect the build. We are now refreshing what we do in the build process to be in the state we want to support updating the official documentation.  
* Src to build reproducibly.  
  * This is almost complete. Work on writing and refactoring reproducible CI tests has been reviewed and feedback incorporated. There are 11 test use cases with different architectures. The next step is to create tests that cover File System variants.  
  * Creating an article for FreeBSD documentation to explain how to test release builds with Poudriere (a FreeBSD tool for building and testing packages, especially in a bulk fashion).


The work package is 100% resourced in March. We have successfully engaged [Klara Systems](https://klarasystems.com/), a specialist agency that delivers FreeBSD work for companies, to provide the remaining resource. 

## Risks, concerns, and variations

Some of the work that we have planned will need to be submitted to the FreeBSD Project with careful timing so that it does not conflict with the release process of FreeBSD 15.0 which begins in September for a December release date. There is a possibility that this could affect project timing, and so we need to decide on the mitigation required. We will be addressing this in April to ensure that we successfully work around this.
